# Code 201 Week 3

## Day 1 User Stories

* As a client, I want an app that displays 3 images and allows users to vote on them so that I can gauge the popularity level of each image.
* As a client, I want to the user to not see the click tally until after they are done clicking so that their choices are not influenced.
* As a client, I want the three images to not be too repetitive so that users won't get bored quickly.
* As a user, I want to see instructions on the page so that I know how to use the app.
* As a user, I want to click a few more times because clicking is fun.
* As a user, I want to see the tally of clicks in a nice chart so that I can see what my favorites were.
* As a client, I want to see the percentage of times an image was clicked out of how many times it was shown so that I get an accurate picture of how popular that image is.
