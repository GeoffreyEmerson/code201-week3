# Code 201 Week 3

## Day 1 User Stories

* As a client, I want an app that displays 3 images and allows users to vote on them so that I can gauge the popularity level of each image.
* As a client, I want to the user to not see the click tally until after they are done clicking so that their choices are not influenced.
* As a client, I want the three images to not be too repetitive so that users won't get bored quickly.
* As a user, I want to see instructions on the page so that I know how to use the app.
* As a user, I want to click a few more times because clicking is fun.
* As a user, I want to see the tally of clicks in a nice chart so that I can see what my favorites were.
* As a client, I want to see the percentage of times an image was clicked out of how many times it was shown so that I get an accurate picture of how popular that image is.

## Day 2 User Stories

* As a client, I want the data to display in a slick looking chart, so that the plebs are impressed.

## Day 3 User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to close the browser or lose power then have the app return to the same state when I come back to the web page so that I can pick up where I left off.
